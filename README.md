# Bank Project.

This project uses the UCI dataset to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.

In the journey to learn more about NN networks, this project uses **MXNET and Scala**.

The project uses a fully connected neural network to predict Y.

The UCI dataset reference is [Banking Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).

[MXNET Scala API](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/)
